## Steps to use for your own server
## For dummies (github beginners)
1. First, you will need to make a github accoun if you dont already have one, it's easy, just go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Once your back here, [Fork this](https://github.com/bwac2517/gwaff/fork), its okay if it doesnt make sense right now  
3. Next, edit the config.yml on your fork, you can find your fork at "https://github.com/[your-username]/gwaff"  
replace the values to what you would like:
```
server_id: 377946908783673344 # your server id
darkmode: true # dark mode or not
title: "GWAFF V2"
bottom_message: "\nCheck out the github on bwac2517/gwaff"
plot:
  range: 60 # how many users to include in the plots
  minium_xp: 500 # anyone with a xp gain below this will not be included in the plots
  rank_range: 20 # the interval it starts a new graph
bar:
  range: 15 # how many users to include in the bar graph
data:
  range: 300 # -1 for all users. how many people to include in data collection
```
4. On your fork, press the Settings button. Now press Secrets. Press New Secret. Now on your discord server, press the cog on a channel, select Webhooks, then press Create Webhook, you can edit the name and stuff, but copy your webhook url. Now go back to your new secret, and paste it into the Value box, and call your secret "WEBHOOK_URL", press Update.
5. Now, your going to create a new file at /.github/workflows/data.yml, press Add file on your fork, then select Create New File, then paste ".github/workflows/data.yml" into the name of the file so it looks like this ![image](https://i.imgur.com/yExkeXO.png).
